    <h1>My Favorite Meal</h1>
    <h2>Banga Soup with Starch</h2>
    <h3>Origin</h3>
    <p>
        Banga soup with starch originated from the Niger-Delta region of Nigeria. It is a delicious soup made from palm nut fruit, an assortment of spices, and a variety of meat and fish. 
        It is one of the most enjoyed dishes by the Urhobos and Itsekiris.
    </p>
    <p>
        Banga soup is made by extracting the juice from the seeds of raw palm kernel fruit. The seeds are cooked till they are
        tender and then pounded thoroughly until the juice is extracted and cooked. Starch is very soft and sticky. As such, there is a technique for eating it, by using your index finger and your thumb
        to press down on one side of the starch, one can cut the size one wants to swallow.
    </p>
